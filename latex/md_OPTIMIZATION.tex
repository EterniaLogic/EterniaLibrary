There are several parts of Eternia Library that require intense optimization.

For example, several math functions are using Taylor\textquotesingle{}s series for estimating Power, Log and trigonometry functions. This wouldn\textquotesingle{}t be an issue, but several functions like cosine, tangent, etc. all have these nested Taylor\textquotesingle{}s series instead of directly implemented their own versions. Or perhaps using a more efficient mathematical algorithm would be wiser.
