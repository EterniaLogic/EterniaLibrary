// The launcher allows for low-level players to get back into space on higher-density planets.
//  It also allows materials to be transported to space at higher levels.

// Launching is a big task, it is very strenuous on the human body and valuable materials.
//  Protection from the strenuous launch can be provided by advanced shields and G-force stabilizers.
