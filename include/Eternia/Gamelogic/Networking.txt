Network:
* Hybrid tiered P2P system, cross-chat between clients.

* All clients are directly connected to gateway, but only for small data purposes. 
* Gateway is only used to Sync data and final verifications. Can't trust P2P.


* Most info is handled by Tier parents, micro-servers to verify data.
* Data Queue and cross-checks between multiple parents/children.

* Clients with fastest speed will need to "Consent" to allow for big data, Tier-nodes, calculations, such as planet geometry hashing, ect.



Terminology:
* Tiers - P2P networks that allows high-speed or regional game nodes or players to handle requests from children players. Trees.
* P2P - Peer to Peer
* Tier regions - Geographical locations in the world where two peers have the closest connections, usually on the same subnet.
* Cross-connects - Used when verifying data or when two players are virtually near each-other. Allows for up to thousands of players near, simultaneous control of vehicles, emplacements, ect.

* Gateway - Geographical "Hub" server controlled by the game. Used for account verification, commands, game systems.
