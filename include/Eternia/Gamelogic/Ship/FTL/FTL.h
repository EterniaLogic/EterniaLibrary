// Hyperlanes are pre-established FTL lanes between systems.
//  X-Rebirth used this idea for interspace travel. Your ship is kind of like a car going along a highway.

//  Whereas, the previous games X, X3TC used Wormhole gates. (EVE Online uses the same)
//  Wormhole gates are the easiest to program and forces players to follow the same rules.

// Jumpdrives pretty much allow travelling any distance at an adjustable jump speed.
//  Startrek showed warp 1-7 engines. (Where the # of the warp speed is the speed of light multiplier)

// No games actually show the time for travelling between stars required for warp.
//  - Player attention span is... small.
